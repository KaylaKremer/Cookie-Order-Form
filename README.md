# :cookie: CookieOrderForm :cookie:
A basic html order form which uses Selenium WebDriver, Mocha.js, and Faker.js to run an automated test with randomly generated fake data.

Please Note: Make sure in cookieTest.js to add the appropriate path to the cookieForm.html on your computer. All files must also be kept in same directory with cookieTest.js inside a folder named 'test' and screenshots inside a folder named 'img' in order for the tests to work properly with the default paths.

You will also need [Selenium Webdriver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-webdriver) and [Faker.js] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/faker).

I used *Beginning JavaScript* by Jeremy McPeak & Paul Wilton as a reference for this project.
