# CookieOrderForm
A basic html order form which uses Selenium WebDriver. Mocha.js, and Faker.js to run an automated test with randomly generated fake data.

Please Note: Make sure in cookieTest.js to add the appropriate path to the cookieForm.html on your computer. All files must also be kept in same directory with cookieTest.js inside a folder named 'test' and screenshots inside a folder named 'img' in order for the tests to work properly with the default paths.

You will also need selenium-webdriver (https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-webdriver) and faker (https://www.npmjs.com/package/faker).
